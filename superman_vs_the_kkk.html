    <center><p>In 1946, a man named Steston Kennedy broke into the KKK headquarters and stole a lot of <br>their information. Instead of going to the goverment with the organization's plans, Kennedy took <br>an unconvetional route and went to the producers of a Superman radio show called, <i>The <br>Adventures of Superman</i>. The producers agreed and created a new radio show episode called, <br><i>Clan of The Fiery Cross,</i> in which Supeman fights the KKK.</p></center>

    <center><p>The radio show episode, badly hurt the KKK's numbers and they never fully recovered again <br>after the episode was released. A lot of the differnt Ku Klux Klan methodologies were shown such <br>as their seret handsakes and codewords.</p></center>
