    <center><p>Superman was and is a very influential character throughout his existence. He was able to <br>fight and destory a lot of evil groups during his history, such as the KKK or the Nazis. But he's <br>not finished yet and has continued to be used as a symbol for change even during the last few <br>years. For example, <i>Superman Smashed The Klan</i> were a series of comics released by Gene <br>Luen Yang in the past few years and in it Superman has stopped Asian hate. Superman is a symbol <br>of hope just like how Uncle Sam is a symbol of America's patriotism and his meaning is not <br>stopping anytime soon.</p></center>
