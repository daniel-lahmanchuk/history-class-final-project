    <center><p>During WW2, a lot of differet characters were used for recruitment posters and movies, not <br>just Superman himself. For example, Mickey Mous and Donald Duck were used in some movies to show <br>their love of America and trying to get young men to join the war effort.</p></center>

    <center><p>Superman wasn't just used for recruitment posters and movies during the war. He was also <br>used as a comfort blanket for American soldiers stationed in Italy and Germany. The Navy put <br>different Superman comics into their military rations to motivate the sailors and to improve <br>their morale.</p></center>
