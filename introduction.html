    <center><p>Superman is a superhero character who was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster during <br>the beginning of WW2 and Hitler's Anti-Semitist tirade. He was created to represent America and <br>its sense of justice.</p></center>

    <center><p>Superman's origins tell a story of the ultimate immigrant who arrived on Earth from Planet <br>Krypton after his parents saved him as a little child and put him in a rocket to Earth just in <br>time right before the planet exploded. The rocket arrived at a little farm on Earth where <br>Superman met his new "parents" and he was raised. Later, he learns that he gets powers from the <br>Sun which include the ability to fly, shotting lasers from his eyes, incredible speed, amazing <br>strength, and freeze breath. His only weakness is a type of green rock called Kryptonite which is <br>a part of his old planet Krypton.</p></center>
